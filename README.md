# Car-Price-Analytics
# Business Problem
The automotive industry is undergoing rapid transformation with increasing emphasis on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. In this evolving landscape, car manufacturers face the challenge of optimizing pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand. This report outlines a data-driven approach to address this business problem, leveraging techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation. The primary objective of this project is to provide actionable insights to car manufacturers to optimize pricing and product development decisions. By analyzing the relationship between car features, market categories, and pricing, the goal is to identify the most profitable features and categories that align with consumer demand.

# Final Conclusions:

1. Consumers prioritize practicality and functionality when purchasing cars, with crossovers being the most popular category overall.

2. There is a positive linear relationship between engine power and price, but the rate of increase slows down as engine power becomes larger, suggesting an optimal engine power level for balancing performance and cost.

3. Car age, horsepower, number of cylinders, horsepower per cylinder, and luxury status are the most important features in determining the car's price, and luxury brands tend to have higher prices compared to non-luxury brands.

4. Cars with fewer cylinders tend to have better fuel efficiency on the highway compared to cars with more engine cylinders.

5. Body style plays a significant role in the price of cars, with SUVs generally being more expensive than sedans and coupes.

6. Cars with 4dr hatchback as a body style have the highest fuel efficiency, and the average highway and city mpg values have increased over the years.
   
# Recommendations:
Based on the above insights, here are some recommendations for car manufacturers:

1. Electric and hybrid vehicles are gaining popularity, and manufacturers should focus on developing more efficient and affordable models to meet the increasing demand.

2. Alternate fuels, such as hydrogen fuel cells and biofuels, are also gaining attention, and manufacturers should consider incorporating these technologies into their product lines.

3. Fuel efficiency is becoming increasingly important to consumers, and manufacturers should focus on developing cars with better mpg ratings to remain competitive in the market.

4. Horsepower is still important to some consumers, but manufacturers should balance this with fuel efficiency to offer a more well-rounded product.

5. Luxury features, such as advanced technology and comfort features, are becoming more important to consumers, and manufacturers should continue to invest in these areas.

6. To optimize pricing decisions for profitability, manufacturers should conduct market research to understand the price sensitivity of their target market and adjust pricing accordingly.
